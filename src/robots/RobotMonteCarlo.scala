  /* The parameters passed to the robot are:
   * model - a blank copy of the game board model, complete with useful methods, updated by the controller
   * timelimit - the time (in milliseconds) that your robot has to complete their move
   * pierule - whether or not the pie rule is available to use after the first move
   * colour - the colour of your robot (R or B)
   *
   * Other values that are accessible to the robot include:
   * board - the game board in its current state
   * N - the size of the board
   * count - the number of tokens on the board
   * piePlayed - whether or not the pie rule has been played in this game
   * lastCell - the Cell on which the last move was played
   * othercolour - the colour of the other player
   *
   * You should reference the cell at coordinate (i, j) by the expression board(i)(j).
   * This value represents the cell at the given location on the board.
   * Coordinates are zero-indexed, meaning that they range from 0 to N - 1 in each direction.
   * board(i)(j) has attribute colour; model.colour(cell) also returns the colour of cell.
   * Many other helpful methods are available in the model.
